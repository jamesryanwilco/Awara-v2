## üéØ Goal of MVP

Validate whether users engage with and enjoy a choice-driven, gamified approach to mindful eating using an interactive card reveal format.

---

## Core Features (must-have)

### ‚úÖ Onboarding

-   **Short questionnaire:** Gather user goals (e.g., weight management, emotional eating, general health).
-   **Explain concept:** Introduce the core mechanic: ‚ÄúLevel up by choosing, revealing, and completing mindful eating challenges.‚Äù

### ‚úÖ Challenge Decks & Card Reveal System

This is an interactive, choice-driven model where users select challenges from different decks.

-   **Browse with Hints:** Users swipe through a carousel of "locked" cards. Each card displays a hint, difficulty level, and XP reward, but not the challenge itself.
-   **Interactive Reveal:** Users tap a "Select Challenge" button on a card. This triggers a celebratory confetti animation and reveals the full challenge text.
-   **Categorized Decks:** Challenges are grouped into themed decks. The MVP includes:
    -   **Deck 1: Awareness Basics**
    -   **Deck 2: Presence & Control**
-   **User Autonomy:** Instead of being assigned a task, users can browse and select a challenge that resonates with them.

### ‚úÖ Completion Feedback

-   **One-tap Completion:** After revealing a challenge, a "Complete Challenge" button appears. Tapping it awards the user their XP.
-   **Instant Reward:** A modal popup with an encouraging message appears immediately upon completion.

### ‚úÖ Progress Tracking (Per Category)

-   **Categorized Levels & XP:** Users have a separate level and XP bar for each challenge category (e.g., "Awareness Basics").
-   **Level-Up Mechanic:** When a category's XP bar is full, the user's level for that category increases, and the XP bar resets.
-   **Streak Counter:** Tracks consecutive days of challenge completion.
-   **Goal Display:** The user's primary goal, selected during onboarding, is displayed on their profile.
