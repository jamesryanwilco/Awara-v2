MVP Plan – Gamified Mindful Eating App
🎯 Goal of MVP

Validate whether users engage with and enjoy challenge-based mindful eating more than repetitive logging/scanning.

-----------------
Core Features (must-have)

✅ Onboarding

Short questionnaire: goals (weight, emotional eating, general health).

Explain concept: “You’ll level up by completing mindful eating challenges.”

✅ Daily/Weekly Challenge System

Deliver one new bite-sized challenge at a time (auto-assigned).

-----------------
Examples:

“Take one mindful breath before your next meal.”

“Put down your fork once during dinner.”

Clear instructions, simple success criteria.

-----------------
✅ Completion Feedback

One-tap “Done” button after challenge.

Instant reward: points/XP + short encouraging message.

-----------------
✅ Progress Tracking

Level bar (e.g., “Level 1: Beginner Mindful Eater”).

Streak counter for consecutive days of challenge completion.

First Challenge Ladder (MVP content)
Week 1: Awareness Basics

Pause for 1 deep breath before eating.

Put down your fork halfway through your meal.

Eat the first 3 bites slowly.

Rate hunger (1–5) before your meal.

Notice your fullness at the end of your meal.

Week 2: Presence & Control

Eat one snack without distractions (no phone/TV).

Chew each bite 10 times.

Pause 30 seconds before responding to a craving.

Drink a glass of water before snacking.

End one meal with gratitude (say or think one thing).

This gives you a 2-week ready-to-test path.

-----------------
Tech Stack (lean approach)

Frontend: React Native (cross-platform).

Backend/Database: Supabase (user accounts, challenge tracking).

Hosting: Vercel 

Expo - Development platform and tooling for React Native


-----------------
Success Metrics

Activation: % of users who complete 1st challenge after onboarding.

Engagement: Average daily challenge completions in first week.

Retention: % of users still active after 7 and 14 days.

Delight: Qualitative feedback (do users find it fun, helpful, too simple?).

-----------------
Rollout Strategy

Closed beta (20–30 users): Friends, early testers.

Gather feedback:

Were challenges too easy/hard?

Did the gamification feel motivating?

Did they look forward to opening the app?

Iterate challenge design + reward mechanics.
